h1. Training Wheels

Welcome to the wonderful world of Training Wheels.

h2. About

Training Wheels is intended to be a portable, extensible way to share techniques, idioms, patterns, anti-patterns in Ruby

It relies on ParseTree to turn your ruby code into data that can be analyzed and matched against patterns included in files called wheels.
If a pattern matches, you get a suggestion for a better way to accomplish the same task.

h2. Get Started

# Clone it from "GitHub":http://github.com/capitalist/training-wheels
# It's not setup as a gem yet (it needs work to be beta ready) so just run: ./bin/training_wheels to play around.

h2. Get Involved

* Join the "mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/training_wheels and let me know your ideas
* Fork the repository on "GitHub":http://github.com/capitalist/training-wheels, modify it, and then send me a pull request

h3. Feature Ideas

* Literals: Need to be able to work with literals to create wheels that watch for literal values.
* Wildcards: Need an idea for a pretty way to specify wildcards in trigger patterns.
* Suggest Interpolation: Need a way to take values, method names, etc. from the code that triggered a suggestion and use them in the suggestion. Then we could have copy/paste suggestions.
