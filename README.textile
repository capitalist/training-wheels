h1. Training Wheels

Welcome to the wonderful world of Training Wheels.

h2. About

Training Wheels is intended to be a portable, extensible way to share techniques, idioms, patterns, anti-patterns in Ruby

It relies on ParseTree to turn your ruby code into data that can be analyzed and matched against patterns included in files called wheels.
If a pattern matches, you get a suggestion for a better way to accomplish the same task.

h2. Get Started

# Clone it from "GitHub":http://github.com/capitalist/training-wheels
# It's not setup as a gem yet (it needs work to be beta ready) so just run: ./bin/training_wheels to play around.
